# Catalyst

Catalyst iOS SDK is a library that enables you to build iOS apps for your Catalyst project. The Catalyst iOS SDK package contains a host of tools and functionalities that help you in developing dynamic and robust iOS apps, with powerful backends.

The iOS SDK package enables you to handle several back end jobs such as user authentication and redirection, Data Store and File Store functionalities, and function executions. You can seamlessly integrate these Catalyst components in your iOS app by implementing the ready-made functionalities provided by the SDK package, and build on them easily. This saves you from investing time and effort into coding the backend from scratch, and helps you focus more on designing the user experience of the app.
